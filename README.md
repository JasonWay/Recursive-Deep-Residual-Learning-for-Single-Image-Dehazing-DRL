# Recursive-Deep-Residual-Learning-for-Single-Image-Dehazing-DRL

This is the code for our paper entitled "Recursive Deep Residual Learning for Single Image Dehazing (DRL)".

It has been tested on Matlab with MatConvNet and Vlfeat.

To run the code,

Step 1:  under the folder "libs/",  please download and compile MatConvNet and Vlfeat.

Step 2:  run "test.m".

If you find the code useful, please consider cite our paper:
